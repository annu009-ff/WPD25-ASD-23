 <u> <i>Artificial Intelligence is a new technology in the field of computer science.</i> </u>
           “Artificial” means man-made that is not natural and “Intelligence” refers to the ability to think and make decisions.
           Therefore, we can say that making machines like computers to take their own decisions is Artificial Intelligence.
           This could be possible using various computer programming and codes.

           In other words, Artificial Intelligence or AI is a field that makes computers to behave like humans and make decisions on their own.
           Machine learning and natural language processing are all part of Artificial Intelligence.
           Some advanced hardware and software along with the high-level programming languages are used in AI applications.
